LogParser
==========

Log Parser is a customizable library for parsing log files and present a multidimensional summary of the data in different formats.

Customization is done through a JSON configuration file. 

For a quick example, run the maven assembly goal to create a bundle with all the dependencies:

<pre>
mvn clean package assembly:single
</pre>


Execute the generated jar, replacing 'X.X' with the current version you're using:

<pre>
java -Xms256m -Xmx256m -jar target/log-parser-X.X-jar-with-dependencies.jar -configfile config.json -logname example
</pre>


This parses the 'EXAMPLE_log_2008-12-15.log' using the configuration found in 'config.json'. Both files can be found in the root directory of the project. 
The output is a '.png' containing a bar chart view of the log file, and a '.csv' containing a summary and descriptive statistics.
